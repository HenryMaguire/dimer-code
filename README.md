# Background

This repository contains the notes and code for investigating the charge dynamics of a driven molecular dimer in an open-quantum systems treatment. The dimer is modeled as two interacting dipoles each strongly coupled to an independent bath of phonons. At this stage, the ambient, incoherent electromagnetic field couples weakly to the delocalised vibronic states.

# Requirements

All the python files are written in Python 2.7. Requirements are:
- qutip >=4.0

Conda install is recommended. For information regarding qutip installation, please see qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html 


# Getting started

Open up the `intro.ipynb` notebook and follow along
