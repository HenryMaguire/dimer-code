I have just finalised the laser-style rate model and it seems to qualitatively (and even quantitatively) agree with the CCME solution. The insight that I’ve gained from doing these calculations has also been astonishing.
I’m aiming to give Ahsan and Jake a draft on Wednesday.
–	For weak-ish V, calculate steadystate population ratios and plot them against those from the rate model
–	Write up all the theory required to get to the steadystate laser model for population ratios. 
–	Hypothesis: coupling to phonons causes renormalisation of the exciton coupling, diminishing the exciton energy gap. This decreases DS population for two reasons: 
–	Residual bathspectral density sampled at smaller energies
–	Phonons have smaller gap to overcome, so more upward thermal reexcitation of BS
–	Optical spectral density samples bright state at smaller energy
–	Laser model: 
–	equations of motion + steadystate solution in terms of DS/GS population ratio
–	Write down proposal for rates for the model: need eigenenergies and states
–	Single mode polaron transformation (Does this guarantee eigenenergies are the same?)
–	Full model is not exactly solvable due to non-commuting intramolecular term. Displace out vibronic coupling term - still not exactly solvable due to non-linearity of displacement operator. 
–	Use an ansatz to esimate energy - compare to original forms for eigenstates. Product form of ansatz is missing manifold mixing and many polaronic effects but should be valid for weak enough excitonic coupling.
–	Show eigenenergy agreement
–	Hypothesis is correct: 
–	higher RC frequency leads to smaller displacements - smaller gradient
–	Plot Gamma_BD/Gamma_BG
–	What can the model not predict? Qualitatitive behaviour but not quantitative - all theories are similar when plotting wrt displacement, suggesting that the rate model only accounts for displacements and not more complex processes
–	Coherences
