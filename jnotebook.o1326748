Starting jupyter-notebook on node676 port 8888

You must now ssh in to the CSF from your local machine and tunnel
to the backend compute node. Use the following command on *your*
computer (not on the CSF):

  ssh -L 8888:node676:8888 mbcxrhm2@csf2.itservices.manchester.ac.uk

You should then start a web-browser on *your* computer and browse to:

  http://localhost:8888

When you have logged out of your notebook in the web-browser you *must*
run the following command on the CSF to stop the Jupyter server:

  qdel 1326748

Then log out of your tunnelled ssh session.
