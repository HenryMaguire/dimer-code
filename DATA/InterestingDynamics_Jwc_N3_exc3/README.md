The parameters are w_1 = 1500, V=10, bias=250, alpha_1=alpha_2=1/pi
So this system should generally be in the weak-coupling regime, as well as 
the localised electronic regime (eigenstates should basically be the sites).
However, it's as if the dark and bright dynamics and steady states
 are swapped round in the nonsec (sec) and phenomenological versions.
A few points:
- At weak coupling all the dynamics should look roughly the same (apart from any non-secularity in the electronic part, which shouldn't occur due to the large bias (?))
- the dark state should roughly equal site 2 in this regime
- the dark state will have a marginally smaller dipole moment than site 2
- the dark state (site 2) has a lower energy that bright (site 1) so will
  couple to the field less strongly.
- These dynamics agree with those for a flat optical spectrum
